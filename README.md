## Built With

I used the Lua language to develop the custom configurations. packer for the installing packages. harpoon for navigation files instantly. lsp-zero for the lsp servers. Telescope as fizzy finder. For Syntax highliting I used treesitter and undotree visualizes the undo history and makes it easy to browse and switch between different undo branches. Created custom colors lua file for nvim colors
